# Object_detection_Yolov8
This project is aimed to identify animals using YOLOv8 ML model for building an animal deterant system using Raspberry Pi 4 as the SoC. 
Medium sized Yolov8 model is used due to limiations of the specs of the Raspberry Pi 4. 
This is done for a modular setup with sirens and flashers.
